# AI Workhop prepared for a Full-Stack + AI internship

## praisePal - AI helping you, or your manager, classify performance reviews

### Overview

This repository is a template designated to help interns gather information and hands-on experience
on Natural Language Processing tasks. 

The interns will have the chance to use state-of-the-art
tooling from Hugging Space to quickly use and fine-tune models for specific use-cases.

### Structure of the repository

- train
  - folder including a Jupyter Notebook consisting of a template tackling a Multi-Class Sequence Classification problem

- server
  - folder including a simple API built using FastAPI, also templated

- praise-pal
  - folder including a simple React application use for visual support


### Approach

1. Multi-class Sequence Classification problem
The first part of the workshop will consist of a peer programming session following the steps in the Jupyter Notebook.

Interns will be presented with the available tooling and some basic techniques regarding NLP and training/fine-tuning AI models.

2. Binary-class Sequence Classification problemn
The second part of the workshop will consist of a new given task, but this time, the interns will work by themselves.

Interns are expected to use the previous example and, supported, to finish the new classification problem.

3. Integration with a mock server and a mock UI
The third and final part of the workshop will consist of an integration task.

Interns are expected to apply the knowledge gathered so far in the internship and implement small changes to the existing 
server and client solutions. 

Interns are **required** to have fun testing the application and classifify their reviews of each others with the models
built by themselves.
